# iTrust2

iTrust2 was founded as a class project for CSC326 Software Engineering in the Computer Science Department of NC State University and is maintained by the Software Engineering Faculty and their students.

iTrust2 is an electronics health records system (EHR) that provides patients with a means to maintain their health records and communicate with their health care providers (HCPs). HCPs can record information about office visits including basic health metrics, diagnoses, and prescriptions. iTrust2 follows HIPAA statue for ensuring security and privacy of patient records.

The base project iTrust2 v7 can be found [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust2-v7) and the developer's guide [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust2-v7/wiki/developers-guide)

A team of six people worked on the base project to deliver this version with additional functionality.
We added support for:
 - Pharmacy Locations
 - Pharmacist HCPs
 - Patient preferences for Pharmacies and Prescription Brand
 - Automated sending of prescriptions to Pharmacies
 - Pharmacists filling prescriptions
 
Most of my work on this project was on the backend implementation (persistence classes and REST APIs). A more verbose and illustrated description of my work is [here]()
